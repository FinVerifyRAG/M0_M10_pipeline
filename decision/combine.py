--------------------
M8 Answer-level combination: aggregates per-atom decisions into a final
answer-level outcome and structured response object.

Answer-level rule (conservative / paper-aligned)
-------------------------------------------------
An answer is "SUPPORTED" only if ALL atoms pass (SUPPORTED or judge-VERIFIED).
If ANY atom is ABSTAINED or NOT_VERIFIED, the answer cannot be fully supported.

Combination table
-----------------
| All atoms                | Answer status    |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| All SUPPORTED            | FULLY_SUPPORTED  |
| All SUPPORTED + VERIFIED | FULLY_SUPPORTED  |
| Some UNCERTAIN remain    | PARTIALLY_VERIFIED |
| Any ABSTAINED            | PARTIALLY_VERIFIED |
| Any NOT_VERIFIED         | PARTIALLY_VERIFIED |
| All ABSTAINED            | ABSTAINED        |

The per-atom breakdown is always returned so the UI can annotate each claim.
